## Overview

This project focused on recognizing handwritten digits using a deep learning model built with PyTorch. The goal was to achieve high accuracy on digit classification tasks using neural networks.

## Key Features

- **Dataset Used**: Trained on the MNIST dataset.
- **Neural Network Architecture**: Implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with Tanh activation and Softmax output.
- **Model Optimization**: Used Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss for efficient training.
- **Visualization**: Leveraged TensorBoard for tracking loss, accuracy, and gradients during training.

## Technologies Used

- **PyTorch**: For building and training the neural network.
- **TensorBoard**: For model visualization and performance tracking.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and implementation.
