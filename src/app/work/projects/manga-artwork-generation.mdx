## Overview

This project involves training an AI model to generate manga artwork annotations based on text input. By leveraging LLMs and fine-tuning techniques, the system improves the automation of manga creation workflows.

## Key Features

- **LLM Fine-Tuning**: Trained Mistral and Llama 3 models for annotation generation.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Translated the Manga109 dataset from Japanese to English.
- **Evaluation & Testing**: Compared outputs across GPT-4o Mini, Mistral, DeepSeek, and LLaMa 3.

## Technologies Used

- **Hugging Face**: For model fine-tuning.
- **Mistral, LLaMa 3**: Used for text-to-annotation conversion.
- **Python**: For dataset preprocessing and model training.
