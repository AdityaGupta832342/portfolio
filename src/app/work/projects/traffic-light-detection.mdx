## Overview

This project involves detecting and recognizing traffic lights using YOLO (You Only Look Once) models, including the latest YOLOv8. The system enhances object detection for autonomous vehicle applications.

## Key Features

- **YOLOv8 Integration**: Implemented a state-of-the-art object detection model.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Optimized inference time for real-world applications.
- **Training Pipeline**: Trained on a labeled dataset of traffic light images.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8**: Used for real-time object detection.
- **OpenCV**: For preprocessing and visualization.
- **Python**: For implementation and pipeline management.
